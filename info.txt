When adding/deploying new contracts: 
- need to update config.ts
- update deployments.mainnet.json with contract address and ABI if it changeSliderValue
- Farms.js to add/remove farms
- TombFinance.ts => getTokenPrice. In this function, contract address like I did for: 
     if (tokenContract.symbol === 'TOMBSHI') {
        finalURL += '0x56fb9d8c3c84dd0c4bb59a157e24a882ddab519a';
      }
- in FarmCard.tsx, add to the depositTokenIcon to add images
